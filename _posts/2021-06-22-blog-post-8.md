Where are the fences that hold me back? Just playing the role of a stranger in a foreign land, enjoying seeing their unrestrained smiles.
Perhaps I have no self-awareness, treating the world as an amusement park, frolicking under the clear sky, shadows inlaid by sunlight.
Where did you come from, where am I going, meet here in a hurry, and part in a hurry. Unwilling to exchange their own secret talk, only to throw the warmth of the masquerade on the Si, in the space cycle more than the pace of the flow of a thousand years as one Alice.
Where are the high walls hindering you? Cross the border at a speed greater than that of light, and look back to life and love.
