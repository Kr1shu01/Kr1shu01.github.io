Life is not necessarily sad, and death may be beautiful. Life is so short, and people are so full of tears.
I have praised the beauty of the world, but the beauty treats me as if it were the first time.
So I was lonely. But what is the reason for the silence of loneliness? There are friends who smile at each other.
Not through the sea of people to have no time to care about him? How can I be alone without immersing myself in the abyss?
But I still firmly believe that the long journey, someone to go with, really is the interest of life.
I will not lose my heart, I will not follow the flow of others, I will continue to be myself!
