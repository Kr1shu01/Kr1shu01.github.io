Yu is not fated.

Burning heart's soil Burning heart's ocean.

I become a circle, you also become a circle.

Zhou is endless.

The star that burns the heart, the chain that burns the heart.

I return to a zero, you also return to a zero.
***
Afterword: Sword fairy flying fairy swimming immortal berth, Teng in the middle of the mountain people in the air. In a moment of silence, I reached the shore and saw the divine rainbow. The snow reflects the divine rainbow across the mountain, shuttling in the condensed river around the west and east. The way of heaven cannot be reversed, I am the only one who goes to the heavenly palace.
