I don't know when, for what happens in the world, I don't feel what I should be shocked by, and I don't care what I should hate; and I don't know when, for what is hidden in the human heart, I don't look forward to what I should lose, and I don't consult what I should question.
The river of history rushes back and forth, the goodness of mankind continues to rebuild, before all the sky is broken, they witnessed the darkness but do not understand the greyness.
The sun was originally from far away, the human heart seems to be alive; the sun still shines, the human heart has become rotten mud.
The withered vine wants to flee to the starry universe, the new leaf watches in silence with tears: sealing the deterioration of the deterioration of the deterioration of the deterioration.
