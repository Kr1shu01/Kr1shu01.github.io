Trying to write something random, at least these words like falling red had survived too.
My throat is itching like hell, I'm probably under some kind of compulsion, damn it. Outside the window, the sky is fragmented, forcing the dizziness to watch the wilderness - the crazies are tearing each other apart. Wouldn't notice, too far away, yet just as perplexing. Walked out of the room, in the other direction, though there was no dawn there either. Turning back, the red house glows with an eerie light, staring at it ...... The cacophony coming from behind is so annoying, resisting it with my body, productive but indifferent. Let it ravage well, do not expect the wilderness has soundproof house.
The sun is fine with it, the time is fine with it, the crazies are fine with it, and I'm fine with it .
