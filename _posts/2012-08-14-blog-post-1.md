When people grow up, they say less and less. Because there is nothing to say, but also because no one can understand. The best friend in fact is not a good friend, only we know.
The words of the heart are hidden, brewed into a secret, only and the right one to talk to each other.
You look at the world it is more beautiful, you look at the world it is more sin, white clouds are still the same, withered flowers have long been in the soil quietly sprouting, the memory of the past life, so that it will not be ordinary in this life.
Said the soul pure, or sophisticated good, said to look down on the world, or do not see through the good.
