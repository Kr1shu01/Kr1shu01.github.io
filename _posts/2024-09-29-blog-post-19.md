Humanity undone, walking alone in the long warm sun.
Watching the beautiful until it dies.
Loveliness and reason take root and flourish in the
Green autumn, determined to awaken.
Light comes through the vapour to my back, strange and familiar.
Moments of absurdity, keeping in touch.
The endless confusion that winds up and dissipates in every beautiful moment.
The wind rises and the clouds swim with hope.
