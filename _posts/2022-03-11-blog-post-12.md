Spring is coming without a trace. The willows on the street should be like this, and my hair is getting grey. Farewell to the Long Pavilion, and look in despair at the vastness of the road.

Spring is gone, and everything is deep. I can't recognise the deer's song in the forest, but I know it's a good face. I'm a lonely man, and I'm happy to return to my dream!
***
Afterword: The hundred-mile long lake is boundless, and a boat on the Jin slowly greets us. The old man beckoned, the tiger returned to the forest and whistled again. I am not going to ask you where you are going, but I am looking for a place where my heart is at peace. The boy is pouring wine, don't say that the other shore is the way of immortality.
