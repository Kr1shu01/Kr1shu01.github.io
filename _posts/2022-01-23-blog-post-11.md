Ming is grand, tops are proud. What is the meaning? To be exhausted by the Lord.
Ming is perplexed, the eyes are wandering. What is there to look forward to? The end of the line is a woman.
Ming is eager, the heart is wandering. What to look forward to? The end of brewing.
Afterword: The winds and cold rains are so cold that the river flows into the night, and the fragrance of plum blossoms is so bitter. I was only able to pull up the mountain with my hands, but I could not help hanging on to the blue tiger. Raindrops sobbed in the sky, cold plums full of fists in a hurry. The Bi-Tiger is hard to ride down, flying over the mountain and meeting the long lake.
