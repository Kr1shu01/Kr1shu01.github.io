Late at night is the time when one is most awake, I took advantage of the distant mountains have been sleeping peacefully, tightly put my most interesting dream, playback.
That dream, however, has also become dull, not as hot as when it was first born.
What was it that took my heart and made it so indulgent? Was it laziness? Timid? Or is it confusion? I don't know but I acted with determination.
I strangled their children in the cradle.
I thought, if they hated me for it, then I would show them the dreams that should be burning from my back pocket.
I would be a great painter, a great poet, a great bookworm; I would ultimately have the luxury of these souls, growing quietly in the sun.
