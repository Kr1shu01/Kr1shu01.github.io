We are in our universe, and the laws of our universe do not allow you to mess with their universe's stuff. If you are found to be secretly messing with their universe, the consequences are - confiscation and destruction of what you have messed with, or driving you out of our universe. Some of us were happy to go to their universe at first, but then we came back, and those who didn't, became the ghosts of their universe.
You know why? Because these people are ultimately from our universe, not theirs. I've heard two stories, one is that the people of their universe rarely see the people of our universe, so the people of our universe eventually come back to our universe after thinking about it; the other is that their universe is not comparable to our universe at all, and the people of our universe think that their universe is too bad, so they still choose to come back. As for the truth, who knows.
Who knows? What can we do if we know?
