Time doesn't leave anyone behind, so don't stay behind, guest.
I used to believe that time can make broken thoughts into unchanging eternity; but now I understand that time will only change everything insensitively.
Time is more than a sea of change, she is a nearly invincible existence. She is ruthless but keen to move forward, rubbing the memory and cleansing the dust; she is domineering but good at camouflage, will be smoothed out and the true love of the mountain to cheat. She is a passer-by of thousands of worlds and a witness to the intertwining of the universe.
I hate, time can not frame the happy; I love, time can smooth out the wounds. Cruising through the gates of time, afraid to speak, unable to look up, at the beck and call.
