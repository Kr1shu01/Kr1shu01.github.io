The Realm.

If there were no barbarians.

The Realm.

There would still be light.

Afterword: Looking round the moon and starry river dreaming, hearing the music and the sound exhausted. The sky is not on earth, and the clouds and mud are wailing and lamenting. Eternal life should be the tincture of Chang'e, and the swan should be sentenced to death. If the human world can be spoken of, I will search for light in the depths of hell.
