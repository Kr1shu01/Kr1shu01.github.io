Hello everyone, I am Gui Yiming from Jiangxi Province, China. I am a science fiction enthusiast and a budding writer. My greatest aspiration is for humanity's flame to endure, for our journey to transcend Earth, to venture beyond the Solar System, to escape the confines of the Milky Way, and to spread across the vast expanse of the universe.

If you say you want to join the ETO, I will undoubtedly stop you without hesitation! To eradicate human tyranny? NO NO NO!

From Earth.

This article will talk about sci-fi, and Nemo means Captain Nemo Muoi.<br>

To a large number of people who don't know anything about sci-fi, it's just some impractical ideas that are at best novelistic. I'm going to call them “laymen” here. Laymen may not have been quiet to savor science fiction to bring their own feelings, but also may only experience the tedium of science, either will not read the book, a glimpse of the ten lines shall not be the essence of the book, or will not look for the book to see, if the first time in the sci-fi will look at some of the “Heavenly Father and Earthly Mother” kind of hardcore king, undoubtedly hit a brick wall, and in this regard, I recommend that just into the field of sci-fi buddies to take a look at Captain Nemo, that is, the “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea”! It's generally a slightly more fun, soft sci-fi. A few days ago, Liu Cixin's “Wandering Earth” can be said to have set off a wave of national sci-fi craze, with the Earth to wander, how grand and magnificent epic imagery, embedded in how touching and deep feelings of family and country, I am the first to see the original. So next I'll talk about the connection between the original and its derivatives.<br>

The original is exquisite, because I read it myself and build up the scene depicted in the words by my mind, and for everyone with different experiences, the scenes and characters imagined are bound to be different, which is one of the charms of sci-fi, in my opinion. I think this is one of the charms of sci-fi. Derivatives of sci-fi, such as movies and TV dramas, or games and other forms of entertainment, bring people direct visual and auditory conflicts, and also enable people to understand sci-fi, but whether they can make the original depicted in such a magnificent and exquisite, is another story. And the original for a good derivative should also be very good, it is not possible that the original is like a running gag, but to shoot out a movie that has won numerous awards.<br>

As far as I'm concerned, there are three types of sci-fi: the Arthur C. Clarke universe, the Cyberpunk Terran, and the Uncharted. Arthur C. Clarke universe style, with the big universe as the background, generally to Star Wars, interstellar immigration, exploration, etc., mostly to the very fine depiction of the universe and the novelty of the alien life depicted eye-catching, representative of the “meeting with Rama”, “Space Odyssey Series”, “Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy”, “The Three-Body Problem”, etc.; Cyberpunk, with the background of the Earth, generally to the robots and other AI and human stories, mostly with fresh AI settings and thrilling stories, and the robot. Fresh AI settings and thrilling storylines to attract readers, represented by Thirteen Layers of Space, Player One, Clockwork Girl, Neuromancer, etc.; Unknown style, perhaps called sci-fi because it's fictional, right? Representatives of 1984, The End of the World in Flocks of Birds, etc., why do I call them Unknown style? Read the book yourself.<br>

Also, there's a key word that's often mentioned - utopia. Utopia, i.e., the land of Utopia, the place that doesn't exist. Overflowing with peace, happiness, no war, no poverty, everyone is equal, live in peace and work in contentment, no power, no dictatorship, such a place is contrary to human nature, so reflective people jumped out of the woodwork, wanting to write anti-utopian style books to satirize and admonish those in power, how to say? We all actually know this by heart.<br>

In the past I always put fantasies about the universe, I pondered that there must be alien life, and that they might have come to Earth after I wrote this line, or they might have come after you read this line, but if none of that happens, there's no need to make a big deal out of it, I'm just saying that it might. The universe is colorful and dark; human nature is colorful and dark. When a supernova explodes, we may see two “suns” in the sky; when a black hole swallows the earth, humans may have gone to a new home; when robots are waiting for humans to return to earth; when aliens take the earth for themselves; when human beings degenerate, and when a bright spark appears in the sky.

Unleash the imagination.

<p align="center">**Bouquet and Veil.**<br>

The flower girl holds the bouquet above her head, her bright smile revealing the solemnity of innocence. The petals of the flowers fall, dropping a nebula, and the light winds blow the fireworks in splendor. The leaping branches bring back memories of bouquets and veils.<br>

The bride's delicate makeup behind the veil, with the flow of that time emerged. Guan Er, a frowning dance partner, floating in the breeze, until touching his cool ice-like hands, not in vain these six years of waiting. The courtyard was full of high-flying people, white-haired, black-haired, and red-haired, drinking, laughing, eating, making noise, the shy little girl holding a cluster of bouquets of flowers, unable to restrain the delight bursting from the corners of her mouth, a beautiful moment. After hearing a clear chirp, the little girl shifted her gaze to the depths of the jungle, flocks of birds fluttered, colorful plumage interlaced climbing, as if a supernova erupted, but also like fireworks, the bride's eyes abruptly shook a white light, and then when she opened her eyes, she remembered that it was the reflection of glass prisms hanging on the door. Playing music, the bride dragged a white dress, full of joy, to the direction of the groom stepped six steps, to the white clouds and blue sky stepped six steps.<br>

The groom, however, is impassive, quietly and unexpectedly raising his hands, his left hand in the shape of a gun to his temple, his right hand in the shape of a V in a gesture of victory. As far as the eye could see, there was silence, and he lifted his tilted face, revealing a smile that had been missing for a long time. A fireball appeared in the near sky, brighter than the sun, more beautiful than the moon, brighter and brighter, more and more beautiful, freezing time into eternity.

<p align="center">**Ice Ribs.**<br>

The waves came in on the wind, strong and powerful, lapping at the cliff edge. In a few years, maybe it won't be so cold, the old fisherman crossed his arms and peered out the window of his cabin. The waves of the Pacific Ocean were already becoming more frequent, but the sea level was still so high, and the Oriental Pearl Tower on the other side of the river was still sleeping under a thick layer of ice.<br>

After a sip of wine, the old fisherman picks up his harpoon and pushes the door open to the cold wind, it's time to go out for food again. A little way down the hill, you see sea ice, and many longitudinal and intertwined ropes along the shore, hanging with a wide array of seafood. The old fisherman's craft feeds his family, but not his illness. The old partner also left early, has been a long time not to mention this, the son of nine to five, in fact, is in the vicinity of the newly built base as a handyman, but fortunately not idle.<br>

A stick down, the ice prongs are “click” broken, swish fall down. Day after day, the old fisherman also took this as a pleasure, because this kind of crisp sound, just like his old heart, are lamenting this cold and harsh world. Every night the waves, wrapped in the sea breeze, skimmed over these ropes and swirled and froze, one drop blending into another, and another, and a starry night slipped by in this endless stream. Early in the morning, a single rope was lined with ice prongs, each one stretched out at a different angle, and the cold wind whizzed through them, lifting flakes of snow from the ground. By midday, the heat of the sun was not even enough to melt them completely, and if these ice prongs were not cleared every day, they would grow wildly like weeds in the wilderness, growing longer and heavier until they crushed the ropes that held the seafood.<br>

The old fisherman picked one up with his hand and headed for the woods on the mountainside, where he sat down under an old fir tree. Looking up at the pale, lifeless sun, he held the crystalline contraption in his hand in front of his eyes, and looked through it as if the sun, too, had brightened and warmed, and the world was not so cool.

<p align="center">**Dream of Rain.**<br>

Last night's rain may be spiritual, for it seems to have dreamed of me.<br>

Rustling? Open the curtains, what upset my sorrow, so elegant, so dashing? Oh, it is you! From the clouds of the distant night sky, to the thirsty ground to go, you cut through the night curtains, persistent impact on the surface of the city, and the competition with the earth, this opened the curtain. You crash into steel sunshades, composing a piano-like tune, and then you rush headlong into puddles and puddles of mud, melting yourself into ripples of haloed impermanence. At the end of the day, you fly through the air, wander through the darkness, the leaves are your band, the flowers and plants are your dance partners, and you leap up again, bursting into unique streams, waving a great art that belongs exclusively to yourself. ......<br>

Whose sobs, shattered my dreams, and when, who's sadness did I dream? The ticking rain won't say she's sad, the clattering rain won't say she's confused, and hearing my sobs, the rain drifted through the barred windows and into my room, splashing my cheeks and eyes with a misty, steaming coolness - I could truly feel it with my mind, for the rain had passed through the skin of my face, and with the blood, flowed I could really feel it with my heart, because the rain had flowed through the skin of my face, along with the blood, and entered my heart; I could clearly imagine it with my mind, because the rain had seeped along my pale skull, into my brain, and seeped into my dreams.<br>

The world, which I had felt faint at the time, was now back to its original form.

<p align="center">**Sand Lamp Thunderstorm.**<br>

A plain-colored lamp post engraved with exquisite nautilus patterns stands on the vast expanse of yellow sand. Ice-crystal-like grains of fine sand, circling around the pole upward, tornado-like straight to the clouds, so the sky darkened, the crisis surfaced.

Suddenly red light flashes, white light clear, the brightness of the lamp is not from human hands: red diamonds mixed flying, white sand sky shuttle, more and more quickly, no longer see the shadow. The wind roars, like madness everywhere, with the sand, overwhelming. Lights out again, can be seen more carefully in the darkness of the night a slight static electricity, conveyed between the sand particles, connected. As if the grid, but like a spider, due to the red diamonds refractive light, the ghost of the night, red electricity.

The more frequent the brightening and extinction, the more crisp the sound of electricity sizzles, as if in the distant void of space, will also be surprised by this thunderstorm. Yellow sand dense and sparse, sparse and dense, light and shadow interlacing, the final gathering, annihilation. The red diamonds are connected into a line, the white sand is spread into a surface, a loud sound that runs through half of the desert, a strong light that illuminates half of the night sky, and a sand pit with a circumference of 5,000 meters, they came with such fanfare, and they came ...... silently.

Calm down with the sand fall to the ground, the horizon jumped red light and white fog, seemingly unwilling to wither the flowers. Splendid flowers fill the golden desert wilderness; the silent night sky, stirring the distant silver waves.

Whose descent are you still waiting for, whose mourning are you still pursuing? Is this an eternal remembrance, or an unforgettable memory? Double shadow into the sand stars, the stars of the moon light cold and miserable, lift the eyes, when the stars have fallen into the sand dunes, when the morning light actually leapt to the east mountain?

<p align="center">**Cloak and badge.**<br>

He was a handsome young policeman who had longed much for the glittering starflower on his shoulder patch.<br>

She was a young and naive thief who never wanted the glamorous life of the rich.<br>

In the city, the night starts, the light is dense, pedestrians move. A normal night, he had just been laid off, thinking that instead of going back to the dim corners of his own rented house, it would be better to go to the neighborhood which tavern to soothe the tired body and mind. At a speakeasy near the center of town by an overpass, he didn't want anyone to think he'd secretly ordered that Bloody Mary and sat down in the middle of the hall. The table, full of his proud and humble dignity, along with the reality of not having gotten a promotion in years, irrigated his stomach with sadness.<br>

The countryside, the blue sky, the smoke from the valley stacks. A midday full of unknowns, she picked up a little money from the city, on the way back to buy a bottle of watermelon flavored soda as a treat for themselves, thinking that her mother should be harvested today must also be quite fruitful, I do not know if they will remember to buy their favorite peach cobbler. The sunlight reflected on her cheeks, warm as it was, and the shade of the trees didn't sound the dance of summer. From the half-height of the roof, she cooed her knowledge of the world's beauties into her white-toothed lips, along with the chirping of insects and birds in the countryside.<br>

Years later, his badge glowed an eerie red on her cloak. She remembers the remnants of the good old days, and he looks forward to the glory of the unknown and eternal.<br>

The cloak weeps and the badge laughs. No one knows who and where the road leads!

<p align="center">**The fall is still the same fall.**<br>

The wind collapses the pine needles, which fall into the saltwater marsh, and the rain seems less real. The moist air held raw power, and the rain fell into the wind like a glowing diamond in the dark night, angular and dripping into the dark lake, creating many messy and delicate ripples. The sky and the clouds mingled, unable to see each other, who was black and who was white.<br>

Abruptly, a distant lightning rush down, the sky surprised a small piece of light purple, is like wisteria. White transition into purple, fading into deep black, sinking into the dark night, constituting a door of light, over there is far away. Lightning, like a white dragon, traveled through it, sending gusts of legacy to the world.<br>

The abandoned red-walled and black-tiled house, huddled in the storm, suffers from the whiplash. The room is overgrown with thistle, flowers and insects are dormant, decaying in the fragrant soil, among the pebbles. The roar stops, the rain gets heavier, and the only thing you can hear is the leaves hitting the forest.<br>

The wind is still fresh and quiet, the rain is still pouring, and it is still the same legacy.<br>

Wake up in the morning, the piercing sense of light came, the sky is blue and transparent, there is not a trace of clouds in the sky, like a piece of flawless cloth. The reeds around the piece, the culvert is still silently flowing, two water ripples meandering, breaking the silence of this ultra-void.<br>

The muddy path weeps, some giant reptile leaving a clear track. This legacy will not be filled, will not be stained, with a trace of blood. Even if civilization leaves me behind, I will no longer chase civilization, I will enjoy this legacy ......

<p align="center">**Under the City of Chang'an.**<br>

The coelacanth's struggle for survival began that day.<br>

A pterodactyl's clearing cry seemed to signal something, and a dingo rustled through the deep brush. A coelacanth under Mirror Lake is bored and spitting out bubbles, but then, not far away, there is the sound of a giant's footsteps. Peeking out, the fish saw an extremely spectacular scene - dozens, or hundreds of exotic dragons were running towards the lake with great force. In an instant, the wind and rain changed, and the clouds and trees were mixed.<br>

Mirror Lake is the center of the Gondwana Basin and the lowest point of the area. In this world of the weak and the strong, a crisis is brewing. And some sensitive creatures seem to have sensed the pre-apocalyptic calm. Clusters of coelacanths swim to the bottom of the lake, the xenotrons all sink, and soon they all drown, their bodies rising to the surface, a perfect barrier to the storm of doom. And so, the coelacanths waited and prayed in silence. Finally, the world shook with a bang, and the impact left the blue planet covered in gray, and the coelacanth was a fluke.<br>

Roughly 65 million years later, an upright walking mammal ruled the Earth, and the coelacanth underwent the same qualitative change. After all that time in the interior of the planet, it would seem logical that they would have been strong enough to return to the surface, so why did the coelacanths remain silent underground for so long? The reason is simple, because they don't need oxygen anymore, and of course sunlight isn't a necessity. Their source of energy is rock, they have four small hands and two legs, and they did return to the surface, but only in the last few thousand years, when they suddenly detected a great crisis lurking on the surface, just as their ancestors remembered in the distant past.<br>

Coelacanths have seen a lot of people and believe that humans are qualified to exist on Earth, and they firmly believe that their existence will make the Earth more and more beautiful and better ......

<p align="center">**Purple Thistle.**<br>

A sky that loves a scarecrow, and a scarecrow that loves a black dodo. The black raven was a gentleman and the scarecrow thought he was the one. So the scarecrow began a long wait. The sky just watched the scarecrow silently, and he also saw the black dodo throwing “olive branches” to scarecrows all over the world. That day the Black Dodo finally came and said to the Scarecrow, “I'm afraid I can't take you on this journey, because you've become so entrenched in your destiny that you'll have to spend your life in this land. I am truly sorry.”<br>

The Scarecrow looked at the black dodo flying off into the distance sobbing uncontrollably. In an instant the sky cleared and it was the sky that called the sun out. For the sky felt that there was nothing better in the world than the sun when one was at their saddest. Without waiting for the Black Dodo's next arrival, the Scarecrow died on a night of heavy rain. The scarecrow's body decays in the soil and gradually loses its shape.<br>

The following spring, purple thistles appeared on the land. Over time, the flowers of the purple thistle blossomed with a strange beauty that attracted countless bees and butterflies. The black dodo flapped his black and gorgeous feathers, invisibly revealing an air of aristocratic elegance. In the moment of locking eyes with the Black Dodo, Purple Thistle accidentally gained the memory of a scarecrow.<br>

The Black Dodo came to Purple Thistle and said with affection, “I like you, that's all, because liking is always demanded to be free of other superfluous emotions. Would you like to travel the world with me?” Purple Thistle said yes in mock surprise, and she said to Black Dodo, “But I seem to be too entrenched to move freely.” The Black Dodo said, “Don't you worry, I can carry you on my back. You'll be fine. You deserve to see the wider world.” With those words, the Black Dodo uprooted the purple thistle, and in an instant an extremely strong dizziness swept through the Black Dodo's mind. When he woke up again, the entire world was in full view.<br>

He had become the sky. And the sky had become him.<br>

Purple Thistle opened his eyes and he realized that Black Dodo was beside him. He was holding the lake water and moistening the soil around Purple Thistle a little with his beak. Then the winds howled and the rain fell sharply, a new sky at work. Even so, the black raven holds the purple thistle tightly in his arms. Even though his feathers are no longer magnificent, he remains immovable under this sky.

Forge the future.
